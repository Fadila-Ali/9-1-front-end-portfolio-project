## User Stories

- As a user, when I visit the website I see a link to an "about me" page that will navigate to a new page where I see information about the developer.

- As a user, an input box so that I can input the name of any country in the world and have important information about that country displayed on the page once I click submit.

-as a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen telling me to enter a value to search so that I cannot submit without entring a value.
